# Iris_Color_Bot
A Discord bot written in C# used to permit users to customize color roles with automatic contrast enforcement.

Built against .NET Core 2.2.  Build the solution and run `dotnet ColorBot.dll`, so long as it's running the bot is active.

This code is a mess.  Like, copy-pasted shit all over the place.  Please do not copy this overall organization style.  But hey, it works, and it was built in like three days.  You'll need to add the correct tokens etc to the settings.json.
